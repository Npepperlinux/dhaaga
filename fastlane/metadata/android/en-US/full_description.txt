It implements a subset of platform features (relevant to SNS and
cat bases use cases), but crafts them in a modern and well-thought-out manner.

It has a very modern and user-friendly interface, lots of quality of life
improvements and well-considered performance optimisations.

Some unique feature that Dhaaga adds (usable regardless of your server or
software support):

- 🗞️ "Social Hub" helps you manage pins and profiles to easily keep up to date.
- 📁 "Collections" to help organise and view bookmarks locally.
- 📝 "Quick Composer" helps you create posts/replies, in a mini form-factor.
- 🧵 "Thread View" to keep track of reply contexts.
- 📥 "Inbox Categories" to organise and view your notifications/updates.
- 🖼️ "Gallery Mode" for browsing media posts from user profiles.
- 💬 Dedicated "Chat interface" for fun conversations.
