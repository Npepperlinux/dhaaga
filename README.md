# Dhaaga

Dhaaga client is an unofficial, feature-rich social media client for popular social media websites.

Currently supports Meta's [Threads](https://www.threads.net/) platform, with a direction to support other popular [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) platforms.

</p>


Special shotout to [The Wails Project](https://wails.io/) and it's creator [@leaanthony](https://github.com/leaanthony), without whose contribution in the go/js open source community, this project would not have been poossible.

## Vision

### What this app wants to be:

- 🫶 A reimagined way of browsing the Fediverse.
- 🔍 A cross-platform, cross domain interest discovery and tracking tool.
- 🖼️ A convenient and damn pretty ✨ gallery and daily newsletter app.
- 🧑‍💻 An OSINT tool (Disclaimer: FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY! The contributors do not assume any responsibility for the use of this tool.)
- 😇 An API friendly client, with client-side caching and optimisations to prevent spam.

### What this app does not want to be:

- ❌ An official client recognized by any social media platform.
- ❌ An alternative to the official apps (or third party alternatives thereof), with 100% feature coverage.
- ❌ A content scraping tool.

## Disclaimer

This client is designed to be responsible and respectful and it is up to you to decide what you do with it. I don't claim any responsibility if any of your social media account is affected by how you use this client.

</p>

^ For e.g. - I was able to discover this talented artist ([qtonagi](https://www.threads.net/@qtonagi), reposted by [risumi_illust](https://www.threads.net/@risumi_illust)) I never knew about. And I could immediately add them to my favourites and browse their timeline. 🤗

### User Discovery (Dedicated Module)

- ✨ Important parts of the cache for each social media platform will be available via an in-app dashboard.
- ✨ Follow without showing that you follow 😉
- ✨ Your copy of the client. Your login credentials.
- ✨ That means you own all data generated by this client.

</p>

### User Discovery (Database Module)

- ✨ Full access and documentation for your sqlite store.
- ✨ I try my best to design the app to be OSINT friendly for non-techie research scholars, who I am sure can make much better use of the data than me.
- ✨ All features are opt-in. You can choose to not use the features that you don't want to use.

## FAQ

Q. Looks good to me ! Where can I ping you for more features?

A. You can join my [discord](https://discord.gg/k8Wzxea7) to help with development and suggest features.

Q. Will you be supporting authenticated workflows?

A. Well, writing and maintaining wrappers for multiple social media APIs is extremely time-consuming.
However, thanks to the incredible work done by the open source community ([threads-api](https://github.com/junhoyeo/threads-api) by [@junhoyeo](https://github.com/junhoyeo) and co, [masto.js](https://github.com/neet/masto.js) by [@neet](https://github.com/neet) and co), I can solely focus on building the experience 💪.

## Feature Roadmap

Tentative to my availability. I try to ship one major feature per version.

Some features in immediate consideration are (sorted by priority):

- ✨ [favourites page] fovuriting posts and showing liked posts in
- ✨ [search page] rendering support for shorts in gallery
- ✨ [search page] [database] rendering support for multi-image posts
- ✨ [frontend] add threads-api support, to extend the posts that can be fetched
- ✨ [worker] one click sync support, to populate all favourited feeds and delta patch the cache
- ✨ ... or join [discord](https://discord.gg/k8Wzxea7) to suggest additional features 😇

## Final Words

`Dhaaga (धागा)` is a common word for `thread` `yarn` and `string` in Hindi.

In popular culture, strings are used to depict the basis of human interaction self, with nature and each other. 

~~Also, I liked Kimi no na Wa and the name was mostly free in GitHub search results. Hence the name. 🤣~~
